				<h1>How To Play Triple Triad</h1>
				<p>
					The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything, report it immediately. All right, let's go. Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this? TK-four-two-one. Why aren't you at your post? TK-four-two-one, do you copy? Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do. You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here. Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around. We found the computer outlet, sir. Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network.
				</p><p>
					The Death Star plans are not in the main computer. Where are those transmissions you intercepted? What have you done with those plans? We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission. If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador? Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.
				</p><p>
					Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize. Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station! The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as.... The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away. That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy? The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.
				</p><p>
					He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric. Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi? I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about? Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit. I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.
				</p><p>
					What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.
				</p><p>
					He is here... Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Surely he must be dead by now. Don't underestimate the power of the Force. The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion. Yes. Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block A A-twenty-three. The princess! Put all sections on alert!
				</p><p>
					You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen. What makes you think that? Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben. That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now. But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him? He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father. He knew my father? I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.
				</p><p>
					How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.
				</p><p>
					Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid. Don't worry, he'll be all right. What happened? Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece. Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far? Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?
				</p><p>
					We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so small they're evading our turbo-lasers! We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their fighters. Luke, let me know when you're going in. I'm on my way in now... Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower. I'm on it. Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.
